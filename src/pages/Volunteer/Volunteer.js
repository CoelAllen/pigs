            I am convinced that my life belongs to the whole community; and as
            long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can, for
            the harder I work the more I live.

          Volunteers are an important part of the Pigs Peace family. Your
          contribution of time and effort helps improve the lives of all of our
          friends here at the farm and allows us to guarantee lives free of
          cruelty and neglect.

          There are a variety of volunteer opportunities available including
          farm tasks and general support, to technical and clerical help.
          Opportunities change with the season and depending on the needs of the
          animals. Volunteers who wish to donate professional skills are always
          needed such as carpentry, plumbing, electrical, etc.
