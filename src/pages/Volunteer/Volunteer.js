          contribution of time and effort helps improve the lives of all of our
          friends here at the farm and allows us to guarantee lives free of
          cruelty and neglect.

          animals. Volunteers who wish to donate professional skills are always
          needed such as carpentry, plumbing, electrical, etc.
