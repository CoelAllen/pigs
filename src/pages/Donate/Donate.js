              Help the animals by donating money, especially on a regular basis.
              Every dollar helps in our commitment of love. The pigs are on a
              high-quality, well rounded diet and food prices are high. They eat
              300 lbs. of pig food a day and 50-100 lbs. of vegetables, plus
              treats - popcorn, fruits, peanuts, peanut butter sandwiches, etc.
              The pigs also have the finest veterinary care. We desperately need
              monetary support. If you'd like to help out please donate online
              via PayPal or by mailing a check.
